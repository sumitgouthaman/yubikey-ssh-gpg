# Yubikey SSH & GPG setup

I often struggle with setting up Yubikey based SSH auth. These are my notes to help me next time around.

1. [Configuring the Yubikey](configuring_yubikey.md)
1. [Creating and transferring keys](creating_and_transferring_keys.md)
1. [Setting up SSH to use gpg-agent](setup_ssh_to_use_gpg.md)
1. [Setup SSH from ChromeOS and Crostini](setup_chromeos_ssh.md)
1. [Setup new computer as SSH Client](new_computer_as_client.md)
